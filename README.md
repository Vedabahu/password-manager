# üõ°Ô∏è Simple Password Manager (Python Project)

A beginner-friendly password manager built with Python. This project demonstrates basic concepts like encryption, file handling, database management, and user input for securely managing passwords on the command line. Jump to the [demo](#demo)

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **DISCLAIMER**:  
> This password manager is a simple educational project and **not** intended for production or real-world use. If you need a secure, production-ready password manager, consider using trusted solutions like [KeePassXC](https://keepassxc.org/) or [Bitwarden](https://bitwarden.com/).

## üöÄ Features

- Add new password entries (service name, username, password)
- View saved credentials
- Delete entries
- Encrypt and decrypt password storage
- Generate random passwords
- Command-line interface

## üîê Security

- Usernames and Passwords are stored in an encrypted format using basic symmetric encryption (e.g., Fernet from `cryptography` library with key derived using `Argon2id` as the key derivation function).
- A master password is used to unlock the manager and decrypt data.

> **Note:** This project is designed for learning purposes. It does not follow advanced security best practices such as key derivation functions (KDFs), secure vault storage, or tamper detection.

## üì¶ Requirements

- Python 3.13+
- [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager
- `cryptography` library
- `click` for CLI development

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Run the password manager

Automatically install dependencies using `uv` and run the file:

```bash
uv run src/main.py
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Open `src/config.py` and alter as needed.

- `DB_NAME`: is the vault name that will be used
- `DB_PATH`: is the place where the vault should be placed.
